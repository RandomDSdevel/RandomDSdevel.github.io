&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;This is the data for my [Jekyll](http://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) blog, as hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/).  It is automatically transformed by the [Jekyll](http://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) software into a static site viewable at https://randomdsdevel.github.io/personal-and-blog/ whenever I push this repository to GitHub.  
&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;I was tired of not being able to get WordPress.com's post editor to produce quite the results I wanted.  Also, having one's blog posts stored in a database off on some remote server and thus not having a way to easily extract individual posts from it due to the resulting vendor lock-in is justâ€¦asking for trouble, if you take my meaning.  I want to author my posts in an easily manipulable format, locally if possible to keep a backup for posterity's sake.  My blog should be easily stylable and customizable any way I please.  It should provide me with tools to make itself easy to put together, no matter what kind of content I want to host on it or how much content creation I want to automate (archival indexes of any sort can get downright _unwieldy_ to maintain manually!)  Most of all, it's more than likely that I'll appreciate having stored my site somewhere safe for easy retrieval some time in the future.
